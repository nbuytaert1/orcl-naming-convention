Oracle Naming Convention
========================

Check your Oracle database objects and code for naming violations

## About

Most development teams have agreed upon some sort of naming convention as it typically increases the readability and comprehension of the source code.
Defining these rules is one thing, but correctly and consistently applying them is another.
Wouldn’t it be great if we were able to actually validate whether our team-specific naming rules have been applied the right way?
Well, I’ve created a package that makes it possible to list all incorrectly named elements in your database schema.

Please read through the following blog post to get acquainted with the _API_NAMING_CONVENTION_ package: http://apexplained.wordpress.com/2014/04/19/validating-naming-conventions-in-oracle

Minimum required database version: Oracle Database 11g Release 1.
